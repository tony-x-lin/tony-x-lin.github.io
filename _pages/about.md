# About Me
* I am a Robotics PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the Georgia Institute of Technology jointly advised by Dr. Fumin Zhang and Dr. Samuel Coogan
* My research interests lie within decentralized algorithms for mobile robot teams. In particular, I am interested in how communication-limited techniques can be used to create decentralized estimators and formation controllers. 
* I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and an M.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Virginia.
